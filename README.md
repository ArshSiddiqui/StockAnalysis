## Stock Analysis

Stock Analysis is a terminal based system to monitor stocks. The data used comes from Yahoo Finance.

Thus far, it can be used to display your watchlist (which you can add and remove stock tickers from) or to graph 
a specific stock (to view a 6-day plot of it). There is some error handling, but it is not comprehensive.


The following are the options:  
watchlist    - display your watchlist  
add TICKER   - add a stock to your watchlist  
rm TICKER    - remove a stock from your watchlist  
graph TICKER - graph a stock for a 6 day time period
